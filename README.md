## Project Overview

This repository captures my progress and the development journey undertaken to accomplish the assignment.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Set up the necessary dependencies and configurations:
  - From the terminal go in the ShoppingListFrontEnd folder by executing ```cd .\ShoppingListFrontEnd\```
    and there run ```npm install``` to install all the necessary packages for the frontend application.
  - In order to connect the database with the backend it is needed to install postgress where it is asked to create a username and password.
     Next you will have to go to ```/ShoppingList/src/main/resources/application.properties``` and replaces the values for username and password with your own.
3. Run the spring boot and the angular application for testing and development purposes.
